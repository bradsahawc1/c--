Used Microseconds and I made my vectors 1000 long rather than 1000000 because I got impatient.

The conclusion I can make is that using a template in this case is much more efficient than using Inheritance.
My computer spent a lot less time on templates, you can see that where as my time for templates were in the thousands range
the inheritance portion were in the tens of thousands range when it comes to how much time it took.
Thinking if I had let my run with one million go I think the time difference would only be bigger and in company settings where speed is everything
and you have a lot of information being transfered at that using a template would definitely be nessessary.
